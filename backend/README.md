Running this **Ticketly** Web Application requires the following Python libraries :

Flask
flask_sqlalchemy
flask_restful
flask_security

**Required commands**

>pip install flask pip install flask_sqlalchemy pip install Flask-RESTful pip install Flask-Security pip install Jinja2

Once this is done, open the Python file in a Terminal/Command Line:

>python app.py

The database.sqlite3 file needs to be in the same directory as the app.py file, along with the templates and static folders.

The app.py file needs to be run, and then the URL 127.0.0.1:5000 (default Flask port) needs to be opened.

==The application, at this point, will be up and running.==
